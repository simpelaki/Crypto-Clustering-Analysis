# CryptoClustering

# Information
Using the cryptocurrencies, I have found the best K values with the scaled data and PCA data. The original data was first scaled using StandardScaler() module and then the K and inertia values were used to display the elbow curve. From the elbow curve, we can determine the best K value to use for the model.
A scatter plot was then displayed to identify the clusters. For the PCA data, a new dataframe was created with the PCA values before finding the K values. Lastly the K and inertia values were generated, another scatter plot was displayed for visualization. The results were then compared to find which method produced a better visualization for the clusters.
